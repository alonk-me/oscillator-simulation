<h1>Python Physics Project - oscillator chain simulation</h1> 

<p>the project is split into 3 main classes:</p>
<p style="color:green">1. physicist.py - used for managing the experiment </p> 
<p style="color:red">2. oscillator.py - a simulation of the particles</p>
<p style="color:blue">3. lab_report.py - creates the desired files and plots</p>
<p>other then that there are some very minor functions and scripting.</br>
the program is run from the main.py file, and needs the full path, for initState and parameters file, to be inputed in the console.</br>
the output files are saved in the location of the user in cmd.</br>
the libraries used are matplotlib and scipy.</p>
